            Hi, I'm Nick Welch! <img src="https://www.nickwelchportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Portrait-Copy-768x769.jpg" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
              I am a 22 year old Indigenous Alaskan and have been interested in programming since I was 14 years old.
              In high school, I would do lots of Codecademy courses instead of actually focusing on school funnily enough.
              I am currently in pursuit of IBM's Front-End Web Developer Professional certificate as I have found my niche in web development.

          Nick learns very fast and has a great spirit. 
          He's been interested in programming and writing code since he was a teenager.
          Sadly he's never been afforded the chance to apply what he knows and likes to do, until now.

          I really enjoyed working with Nick, he was the go-to when something needed to be done.
          He always went above and beyond and made the step forward when needed.
          Nick's always been very determined to get the job done and help his teammates.

          <span>&#8220;</span>
          I added Nick to our team when we were in huge need of another member.
          Having him on the team greatly increased how organized our projects were and made start to end so much easier.
          He would communicate and take lead with his team members and help them get what they needed done.
